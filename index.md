# Boston Housing Analysis 

For this first lab, we are just doing some basic analyses of a classic dataset to start to come to grips with the tools and techniques of data science. The dataset in question is the Boston Housing dataset, which I've found in the course of doing this lab is actually included [directly in scikit.](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html) This dataset includes a solid 506 entries and 17 dimensions, although for the purposes of this lab we will only be working with two, the number of rooms as the feature variable and the price as the target.
